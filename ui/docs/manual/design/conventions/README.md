title: Conventions
---

The Taskcluster platform is open-ended and can be adapted to a wide variety of situations.
The developers have established some conventions for use of the platform that support some common continuous-integration and continuous-deployment concepts.

While deployments need not follow these conventions, that might lead to confusion for users as the Taskcluster UI assumes they are followed (for example, offering a link to a task group's decision task).
