title: Decision Tasks
---

Useful work often requires more than one task.
For example, new source code might be built on several platforms, or slow tests might be split up to run in parallel.

The convention for accomplishing this is called a "decision task".
Each task group has a decision task, distinguished by having `taskId` equal to its `taskGroupId`.
This task runs first, and creates all of the other tasks in the group by calling the `queue.createTask` endpoint.

As a corollary, it is easy to find the decision task for a subtask: simply treat its `taskGroupId` as a `taskId`.
